this project is part of the series of deep learning projects am currently working on. This CNN model can correctly predict with an accuracy of 81% whether the input image is a cat or dog. It uses max pooling along with relu and sigmoid activation functions.
to access the dataset kindly use the gdrive link provided. To use a custom test case add the test case image to single prediction folder and change the name of location in notebook accordingly.
